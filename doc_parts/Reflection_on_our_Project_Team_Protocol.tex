\section*{Reflection on our Project Team Protocol}

\subsection*{Did you follow the agreement?}
 

We did follow the agreements seen from an overall perspective, but at times changes an comprises were needed.We agreed to meet as a group in order to work on the project at Wednesdays after calls, which we mostly did, but this quickly changed as we realized it wasnâ€™t enough. We kept meeting on Wednesdays, but had to meet during some of the other days as well. We did see this coming, which is why we in the protocol included that we at times would have to set some more time off. For the most of the time we managed to follow our time slots where all team members were present, but at other times this was harder to realize. In cases where some group members couldn't be present, the rest of gathered, and those who wasn't present could stay tuned via Skype.


We agreed to have decent group discussions in cases where we disagreed, and our result should be based on democracy. We did face disagreements at times, but as a group we managed to come with a solution and option that we could all agree upon.


Our group had a good working environment and a smooth process, which made all members comfortable and as a part of the group, and therefore all members contributed to the project and did not keep silent.


We agreed to have an open dialog in case any members did manage to make a task that were given them to them. Most of our work were made where all members were present, and we therefore faced and solved most of the problems together. In the cases where a single members faced problems, an open dialog took place where all members added their perspective on the problem and how we could solve it. 


We expected to face conflict concerning deadlines how we could manage the time. As mention most of the project was done together in the group, and we therefore faced the conflict together. At times where we did not manage live up to the deadlines we had to schedule more time, which we mostly did, but at times this simply wasn't possible which made us divide the work and afterwards reviewed it together.


Most of our sharing were done using Google Drive and later on at GitHub aswel. In the early process of our project out Google Drive failed us where we lost most of our work. Luckily we had a back up which were restored. 
When we were not present and communication was needed it, we used Skype as the main tool and emails if it was more efficient in some cases.

\subsection*{Did the agreement fulfill the purpose?}

Our intention related to the time slots we agreed upon, was to make sure all group members could contribute to the project and be a part of the whole process. Our agreement did fulfill the purpose since our intention was met.


The purpose of the upon and decent group discussions was to make sure we could come with a solution that we could all agree upon and be stratified. This purpose was mostly fulfilled, but at times some compromises had to be made.


In case any members faced some problem the purpose of the open dialog made sure that the members could feel open to share the problems and not keep them to himself. This was actually a very important agreement, which purpose was met, since in a case where a problem was not shared, it would have affected the whole project in the end.


The purpose of scheduling more time in case we did not live up to a certain deadline, was to make sure we would finish the part. The purpose was mostly met, but pushed the deadline of other parts further, which in the end resulted in a certain time pressure.


The tools we used for document sharing and communication made sure all group members was updated and could follow the changes that were made.


\subsection*{Would you, with your experience propose a different agreement?}


Seen from an overall perspective we think the agreements were suitable for our group since most purposes were met. It could though in some cases have been efficient if the agreements had been described in more details. This could have given us a deeper clarification when issues arose and easier to find a solution while referring to the agreement. 


What items would you recommend to include in the project team agreement


It would have been useful and very helpful, if we from the beginning had agreed on how the work structure should take place. An agreed work structure could have made us more efficient concerning our time management.

Agreeing upon which text editor we would use could likewise have been efficient, since we needed to convert documents back and forth. This could at times be very confusing and hard to keep track on the document version.


Seen from an overall perspective we satisfied with the outcome of the project, even though it was a learnful challenge. We managed to look into all the assignments and its related theory. The course, the related project and the process we undertook have been interesting and useful, especially when seen from a professional perspective related to the activities in software engineering. The course addressed a wide range of aspects which gave us a insight and understanding of the processes of software development takes place. Working with the Danish Rejse kort system reinforced or insight and understand, since it was something we could relate to in our daily life.


If we look in to each separate case, we think there a still areas which can be improved. When we reached a certain points in our project, we reflected on some of the work we had done earlier on, and could easily that we could made it a different way or improved it. We did manage to improve some of the work based on the reflection and also based on the reviews, but there is to a degree still room for improvements.
