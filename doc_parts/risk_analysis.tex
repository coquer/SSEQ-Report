		\textbf{1} & Group members leave the group & High & Documents and responsibilities is left undone, this may lead to delays in the project & The rest members will have to develop more, this will mean those responsibilities left behind will be divided with in the rest of group. \\ \hline
		%2 needs to be re writen is a bit confusing or not clear that all
		\textbf{2} & Time fixing/improving the software after debugging & High & More work have to be done & Discuss the case in details and use the supervisor \\ \hline
		
		\textbf{3} & Document delays & High & That the specific group member can’t take new tasks & Project manager has to follow up more regularly \\ \hline
		
		\textbf{4} & Planning and Estimating & High & The plans and estimating document has to done again & Use the supervisor to acknowledge the understanding and discuss in detail in the group \\ \hline
		
		\textbf{5} & Misunderstanding of the task & Moderate & The developed tasks is done wrong & Discuss every tasks in the group and/or use the coffee hours to understand \\ \hline
		
		\textbf{6} & A student becomes ill & Moderate & Can’t participate in supervisor meeting or can’t help developing some documents & Work in groups of two at least or help him come back on track with his work \\ \hline
		
		\textbf{7} & Underestimate size of task & Low & More work have to be done & Discuss the case in details and use the supervisor \\ \hline
		
		%dont we need to explain futher more about kind of tools are we talking about?
		\textbf{8} & Tools for debugging & Low & Product and Project delays & Use the supervisor and make a lot of research about the tools \\ \hline
		
		\textbf{9} & Hardware failure & Very low & Losing some documents & Backup more frequently and all group member has a copy \\ \hline
		
		\textbf{10} & Inexperienced & Very low & The documents and/or debugging of the system isn’t done properly & Use the supervisor, teacher and make a lot of research \\

		Document delays & Project & Some group members doesn’t deliver a document at specific deadline \\ \hline
		
		Tools for debugging & Product & Tools to debug doesn’t seems to be good as the provider says \\ \hline
